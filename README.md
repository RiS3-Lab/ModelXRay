# ModelXRay: On-device Machine Learning Model Analyzer and Extractor for Android Apps 

This repository is the static app analysis tool ModelXRay for our paper ["Mind Your Weight(s): A 
Large-scale Study on Insufficient Machine Learning Model Protection in Mobile Apps"(USENIX Security'21)][1].
The main tool is `modelxray.py`, it requires a default config file `modelxray.config`.
The input of ModelXRay can be either an Android APK file or a directory contains APK files, the output is a directory
for each analyzed app. The directory stores the app's profile containing the detailed information about the model files, 
the machine learning libraries and the evidence. For each machine learning model, it also generate one line 
containing the model's meta data and stored in a file called `reports`.

ModelXTractor is based on [Frida](https://frida.re/docs/hacking/). For each app, ModelXRay generates the customized
instrumentation script for Frida. 

## Contents

- `modelxray.py`: our main tool ModelXRay. 
- `modelxray.config`: default config file for ModelXRay. 
- `configure.sh`: check the other tools that ModelXRay relies on. 
- `app_collections.txt`: statistics for our app collection (we do not provide the original app packages which are huge).
- `measure_lic_reuse`: measure the license reuse among different apps.
- `gpu_usage_analysis`: measure how widely GPU acceleration is used among ML apps/libraries.
- `intercept_scripts`: intermediate scripts used by `modelxray.py` to generate analysis script for ModelXTractor.
- `measure_remote_models`: measure how many apps use remote models (or cloud-based ML services).
- `model_encoding_analyzer`: some tools used for analyzing model encoding.
- `ml_app_profile_analysis`: further analysis based on the results generated by ModelXRay on our collected apps.

## Requirements

- ModelXRay is a static analysis tool, it requires a linux/macOS machine with the prerequisite tools listed in `configure.sh`.
- ModelXTractor refers the dynamic analysis, it requires a rooted phone with Frida installed. You also need to install the Android 
  app for analysis. Once this is set, you can run frida on your host machine with the instrumentation script(ModelXTractor) generated
  by ModelXRay. ModelXTractor will store the suspected model buffer on your phone, and you can pull it onto your host machine for
  verification.

optional arguments:    
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit               
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                        the path of modelxray config file                                                                                      
  -r, --regenerate-report                                              
                        regenerate report even if report is there
  -l, --log-file        store log in modelxray.log(default to stdout)
  -v, --verbose         verbose logging info                                                                                                   
  -f, --fast-run        run fast by only analyzing library and assets, not
                        smali code
  -s, --space-efficient                                                                                                                        
                        save space by not storing non-machine learning
                        decomposed apps
